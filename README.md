Simple console / tk implementation of hangman written during devtrain at Powershop.

Just use runner.rb to run hangman. You can pass the word and lives as env
variables, i.e.:

        $ ./runner.rb --word secret --lives 4
        $ ./runner.rb --gui

It contains a small set of words in data/words which will be picked at random.
